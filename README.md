# Lightning Rails

Hello, Developers!

I'm Dani, and I'm excited to share this latest project as it has been a life changer for me and many other of test RoR users!

Lightning Rails is the result of my combined love for Marc Lou's Shipfast Boilerplate and Ruby on Rails. I couldn’t find a Rails boilerplate tailored specifically for Indie Makers, so I built my own.

The development process was straightforward. I reviewed my projects from the past four years and gathered the most common features and components into a powerful, easy-to-use Ruby on Rails boilerplate. Lightning Rails is designed to take care of repetitive tasks and provides a 100% free tech stack, so you can build MVPs quickly and efficiently.

I’ve been actively improving the code and documentation over the past month, thanks to feedback from more than 100 early users. 

Check out the project website at [https://lightningrails.com](https://lightningrails.com) and let me know what you think. Your feedback is invaluable as I continue to refine Lightning Rails for the developer community.
