# Lightning Rails

Hello, Developers!

I'm Dani, and I'm excited to share this latest project as it has been a life changer for me and many other of test RoR users!

Lightning Rails is the result of my combined love for Marc Lou's Shipfast Boilerplate and Ruby on Rails. I couldn’t find a Rails boilerplate tailored specifically for Indie Makers, so I built my own.

The development process was straightforward. I reviewed my projects from the past four years and gathered the most common features and components into a powerful, easy-to-use Ruby on Rails boilerplate. Lightning Rails is designed to take care of repetitive tasks and provides a 100% free tech stack, so you can build MVPs quickly and efficiently.

## Features

With a `git clone lightningrails`, you’ll have access to:

- 🎨 **20+ Themes** to choose from
- 🖼️ **25+ pre-designed components** that can be rendered with a single line of code
- 👩‍💻 **User authentication** and pages
- 💸 **Stripe payment gateway integration**
- 📊 **Admin dashboards** for managing your app
- 📱 **Fully responsive** design for all device types
- 🪄 **Magic Link Signups** and **OAuth**
- 📄 **SEO tags** for improved visibility
- ...and more!

## Community & Feedback

I’ve been actively improving the code and documentation over the past month, thanks to feedback from more than 100 early users. 

Check out the project website at [https://lightningrails.com](https://lightningrails.com) and let me know what you think. Your feedback is invaluable as I continue to refine Lightning Rails for the developer community.

Happy coding!
